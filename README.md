### Correlation Matrix
A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between variables. Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables. A correlation matrix is used to summarize data, as an input into a more advanced analysis, and as a diagnostic for advanced analyses.

### Logistic Regression 
- Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses regression to predict the probability that data belongs to a certain category as a value between 0 and 1 and classifies it as belonging to a category with a higher probability according to the probability.

- It showed only 78% of accuracy
